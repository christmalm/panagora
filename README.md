# Panagora Code Test

## Start to finish

First a took your product json file and did a product.js
file with all the data.
I used npm to load less and handlebars.
somehow i coulnt load your handlebar file.
First problem to solve was to use browersify and babelify
to solve imports problem.
i used less watch compiler for auto compiling css.
I also used a live server.
i used some font from Google cause i dont think you provide me with a font family and also icons from
fontawsome.
The biggest issue i had was that i never ever used Handlebars and not much plain vanilla javascript.
So was struggling long time with the each block and the syntax.
I think the overall time was 30 hours and around 5-6 hours of that figuring out how to use babelify and browserify and Less.

## To set up my project

When cloning do a npm install and use a live server.  
Open the index.HTML file and right-click on the editor and click on Open with Live Server
